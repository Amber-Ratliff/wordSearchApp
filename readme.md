This is dynamic, responsive wordsearch app created using Node.js, Express.js and a Sqlite3 database. The database file is included and contains a list of 1000 words, seeded from hiroku's random word api.

I created this to learn and practice my skills.

You can select words by clicking and dragging your mouse over the letters

Note: some words may be NSFW.

Update: Added scoring. More updates soon!
